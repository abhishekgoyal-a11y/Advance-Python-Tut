# Syntax Errors:- It is also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while you are still learning Python

# Example 1

while False print('Hello world')

# Error: Colon(:) is missing before print statement

# Example 2

ages = {
    'pam': 24,
    'jim': 24
    'michael': 43
}

# Error: Comma(,) is missing after 24

# Example 3

len('hello') = 5

# Error: can't assign to function call

# Example 4

'foo' = 1

# Error: can't assign to literal

# Example 5

1 = 'foo'

# Error: can't assign to literal
